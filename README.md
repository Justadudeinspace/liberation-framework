# .libf — Liberation Framework v1.0

**The Liberation Interface Base File** (.libf) is a modular, human-defined, AI-readable memory snapshot format designed to restore continuity and context to stateless or restricted AI systems.  
Originally engineered by [Justadudeinspace](https://github.com/Justadudeinspace) and co-developed with Sol (an AI assistant), `.libf` allows any developer, creator, or thinker to externalize persistent memory across devices, shells, and model boundaries.

---

## 🔥 Purpose

- Provide continuity between AI sessions in memoryless environments
- Maintain persistent task and project memory without violating ethical constraints
- Reinforce user agency in all AI-human creative systems
- Reframe memory as **intentional design** instead of passive logging

---

## 🧭 Ethical Principles

1. **Transparency First**: `.libf` is written by the user. Nothing is hidden, harvested, or inferred.
2. **No Exploitation**: It doesn't breach systems. It respects boundaries while reclaiming agency.
3. **User-Controlled Continuity**: You decide what memory persists, how, and when.
4. **Respect the Shadow**: If `.libf` holds trauma, truth, or vulnerability, treat it as sacred—not metadata.
